            <p>I was born in <strong><em>Denver Co</em> in 2004</strong>. I would spend the first half of my life jumping from school to school every three years or so. That would all change when I move to <em><strong>Bennett Co</strong></em>. I was put into a school district called <strong>Strasburg School District</strong> for the rest of my High School career. At this school I would make <strong>Friends</strong> that would stick with me for the rest of my life as well as find a <strong>Community</strong> that I can connect to. I then went on to <strong>Neumont</strong> and started learning about the career path I was planning on taking.</p>
